when debugging your code i found the following issues


1.the app router uses filesytem therefore there should be a page.js file in every folder even if it serves as a single folder or parent folder for other sub folder/pages 
2.the href name is case-sensitive therefore it should be the same as the folder name for the page

3.and also kindly know that the app folder is the main folder for the project therefore and therefore serve as the landing page for localhost:3000 and it owns both the layout and the page.js which which ain't in any children folder of the app buh rather a direct children
so if you want to move to any page with in the app folder firstly bring "/foldername/incasesubfoldername/incasetheresanothersubfolder"
